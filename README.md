## What is this project?

This is what happened: I wanted to make a pretty project with react but had no inspiration, while looking for it I found this video on youtube and went over a lot of things that I have never worked with before, so I decided to follow it (not everything was implemented ut the majority)! Here is the video: https://youtu.be/qALsVa-V9qo?si=cqp9hXP1SOjpfbI3 .

### What are these new things?

Three.js - there is a moving blob and a colorful torus.
email js - the contact page actually sends an email to my personal email.
react-simple-maps - on the contact page there is a pretty map.

(what I was most excited about was three js. Keep in mind that I this is my first time so it's not crazy impressive, but it's pretty cool nonetheless)

## How to run this?
